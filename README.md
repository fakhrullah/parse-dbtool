This is **Work in progress**. We can use it to create migration files and run migration.
But migrations is not record in database, so there will be problem to undo migration.

For now, we can only use it to run all migration on empty database and undo all migrations.

## Introduction

## Setup folders structure so that you can start using `parse-dbtool`

Start using parse-dbtool by initialize folder structure.

```
npx parse-dbtool init
```

This will create following folders:

- `databases\migrations` - contains all migration files
- `databases\seeders` - contains all seed files

## Generating migrations

### Creating new object schema

### Updating existed schema (add field, remove field, change CLP, etc...)

## Migration file structure

## Running migration

## Undo migration

## Seeder

what is seeder

## Generating seeder

## Seeder file structure

## Running seeder
